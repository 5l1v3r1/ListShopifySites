# ListShopifySites
A script to list every shopify site.

# Needs python 2.7.x to run

To use it, run the script listshopifysites.py. It prints the shop id of the shops that it checks whether they exist or not. So you have to stop the script once it gets past somewhere around 20-22 million. Since all the shopify shop ids are below that at the moment. That limit will increase over time of course.

The output will be in shopifysitelist.txt
